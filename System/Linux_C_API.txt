1. iNode

The inode (index node) is a fundamental concept in the Linux and UNIX filesystem. 
Each object in the filesystem is represented by an inode.

=> File type (executable, block special etc)
=> Permissions (read, write etc)
=> Owner
=> Group
=> File Size
=> File access, change and modification time (remember UNIX or Linux never stores file creation time, 
	this is favorite question asked in UNIX/Linux sys admin job interview)
=> File deletion time
=> Number of links (soft/hard)
=> Extended attribute such as append only or no one can delete file including root user (immutability)
=> Access Control List (ACLs)

All the above information stored in an inode. In short the inode identifies the file and its attributes 
as above). Each inode is identified by a unique inode number within the file system. Inode is also know 
as index number.

To see inode number of file, and attribute you can do the following two ways,

1/ ls -i /etc/passwd
2/ stat /etc/passwd

2. Print hardware information
To remember the following information, just try to remember ls*... 

sudo lshw
sudo lshw -short
sudo lscpu
sudo vi /proc/cpuinfo

List block devices
lsblk 
lsusb -v
lspci -t
lsscsi -s

Print SATA devices
sudo hdparam /dev/sda1
sudo hdparam -g /dev/sda1

Print Linux File System Information
fdisk, tool to modify file system partitions.

sudo fdisk -l

3. System Call

int stat(const char *filename, struct stat *buf);
int lstat(const char *filename, struct stat *buf);
int fstat(int filedesc, struct stat *buf);

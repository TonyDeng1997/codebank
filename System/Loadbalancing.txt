Load balancing

Using multiple components with load balancing instead of a single component may 
increase reliability and availability through redundancy. Load balancing usually involves 
dedicated software or hardware, such as a multilayer switch or a Domain Name System server process.
 
A few ways to do this,

Round-robin DNS: by round-robin ip addresses.

DNS delegation: 
one.example.org A 192.0.2.1
two.example.org A 203.0.113.2
www.example.org NS one.example.org
www.example.org NS two.example.org

Scheduling algorithms

Numerous scheduling algorithms, also called load-balancing methods, are used by load balancers to determine which back-end server to send a request to.[6] 
Simple algorithms include random choice or round robin. More sophisticated load balancers may take additional factors into account, such as a server's reported load,
least response times, up/down status (determined by a monitoring poll of some kind), number of active connections, geographic location, capabilities, or how much traffic 
it has recently been assigned.

HAProxy

HAProxy is free, open source software that provides a high availability load balancer 
and proxy server for TCP and HTTP-based applications that spreads requests across multiple servers.

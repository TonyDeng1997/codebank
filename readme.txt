8. String matching brute force
9. graph bfs, dfs
10. Selection rank algorithm
11. majority element
12. max sum of subarry with alternating positive and negative integers
13. max sum of submatrix

    1/ longest word made of other words in the list
    2/ all the substrings
    3/ string permutation

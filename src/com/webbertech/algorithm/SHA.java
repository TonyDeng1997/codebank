	 * SHA1
	 *   160-bit (20-byte) hash value known as a message digest usually in 40-bit hexadecimal format, 
	 *   not secured anymore. Will be stopped in use in 2017 and will be replaced by SHA2, SHA3.
	 *   It is widely used in including TLS and SSL, PGP, SSH, S/MIME, and IPsec.
	 *   Also git uses it for detecting corruption.  
	 * 
	 * The SHA-2 family consists of six hash functions with digests (hash values) 
	 * that are 224, 256, 384 or 512 bits: SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224, 
	 * SHA-512/256. They use different shift amounts and additive constants, 
	 * but their structures are otherwise virtually identical, differing only in the number of 
	 * rounds. SHA-224 and SHA-384 are simply truncated versions of the first two, computed with
	 * different initial values. SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256 are also truncated versions of SHA-512, b

195. Tenth Line
How would you print just the 10th line of a file?
For example, assume that file.txt has the following content:

Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
Line 4
Line 5
Line 6
Line 7
Line 8
Line 9
Line 10

Your script should output the tenth line, which is:
Line 10

Hint:
1. If the file contains less than 10 lines, what should you output?
2. There's at least three different solutions. Try to explore all possibilities.

Solutions:

1/ tail -n +10 line.txt or head
2/ awk 'NR == 10' line.txt
another one: awk '{if(NR==10) print $0}' file.txt
If the record number (NR) is 10, print the entire record $0. 

3/ sed -n '10p' line.txt

4/ IFS=$'\n' ;arr=($(<file.txt)); echo ${arr[9]}
Array based solution.

5/ cnt=0
while read line && [ $cnt -le 10 ]; do
  let 'cnt = cnt + 1'
  if [ $cnt -eq 10 ]; then
    echo $line
    exit 0
  fi
done < file.txt

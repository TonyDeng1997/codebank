AVL Tree

Once you have a set of data [10,14,19, 27,31, 35, 42], you can build different bst trees, many of which are not balanced.
AVL tree checks the height of the left and the right sub-trees and assures that the difference is not more than 1. 
This difference is called the Balance Factor.

BalanceFactor = height(left-sutree) − height(right-sutree)

AVL Rotations
To balance itself, an AVL tree may perform the following four kinds of rotations −

Left rotation
Right rotation
Left-Right rotation
Right-Left rotation

For detail of left-right rotation and right-left rotation, please refer the following,
